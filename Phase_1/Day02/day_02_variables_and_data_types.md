# Day 2: Variables and Data Types

## Theory

Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. Python supports several data types, including:

- Integers: Whole numbers (e.g., 5, -3)
- Floats: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001)
- Strings: Text enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Hello", 'Python')

### Declaring Variables:

```python
x = 5            # Integer
y = 3.14         # Float
name = "Alice"   # String
```
