# Day 7: Loops

## Theory

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. The two main types of loops in Python are `for` loops and `while` loops.

### For Loop Example:

```python
for i in range(5):
print(i)
```

### While Loop Example:

````python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    ```
````
