# Day 3: Basic Arithmetic Operations

## Theory
Python supports various arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The basic arithmetic operators are:

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulus: `%` (remainder of division)

### Example:
```python
a = 10
b = 5

sum = a + b         # Addition
difference = a - b  # Subtraction
product = a * b     # Multiplication
quotient = a / b    # Division
remainder = a % b   # Modulus
