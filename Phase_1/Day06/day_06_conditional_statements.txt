# Day 6: Conditional Statements

## Theory
Conditional statements allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on specific conditions. The basic syntax includes `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

### Example:
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
elif age < 13:
    print("You are a child.")
else:
    print("You are a teenager.")
