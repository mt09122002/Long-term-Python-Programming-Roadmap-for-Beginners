# Day 8: Loops and Conditions (Odd or Even Check)

## Theory

Loops and conditions are essential concepts in programming. A loop allows you to iterate over a sequence of values, while conditions help control the flow of the program by checking if certain statements are true or false.

### Key Concepts:

- **For loop:** Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or range).
- **If-else condition:** Used to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

### Example:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{i} is even")
    else:
        print(f"{i} is odd")
```
